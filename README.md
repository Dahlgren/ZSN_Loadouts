# ZSN_Loadouts

This mod alters loadouts of vanilla units in Arma 3.
Apex is required, Marksmen DLC is recommended.

- NATO now use SPAR Series as main weapon, they make more sense as a future NATO rifle
- The MX Series is now a CTRG Prototype weapon system much like the Type 115 for CSAT
- ACP-C2 .45 ACP is now the NATO heavy handgun, used by officers
- NATO Sharpshooters now use Mk18 EBR, swapped with AAF
- AAF Marksmen now use the Mk-I EMR, swapped with NATO
- AAF Now use the 4-five .45 ACP as main handgun, it is from same manufacturer as their Mk20s
- AAF AR's now use LIM-85, it is the same caliber and manufacturer as their Mk20s
- AAF Now have tan coloured Mk20s, to match their new handgun.
- The Camo Mk20 versions are still used by the FIA
- FIA Marksmen now use the Mk14 Battle Rifle
- FIA AR's now use Zafirs, they probably got them from the same place as the TRGs
- CSAT AR's now use Mk200s, it is the only AR that has the same caliber as their Katibas
- CSAT infantry now use crew helmets, it think it makes for a much better "Future soldier" look
- CSAT infantry helmets now used by CSAT Pilots, I always thought they looked like pilot helmets
- CSAT Pilot helmets now used by NATO Tropic pilots, it was the same helmet in a different colour
- Some other small tweaks to loadouts that I don't remember
